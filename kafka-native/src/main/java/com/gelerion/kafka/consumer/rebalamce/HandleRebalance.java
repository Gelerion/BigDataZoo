 * event youâ€™ve processed. If your consumer maintained a buffer with events that it only processes occasionally
 * (e.g., the currentRecords map we used when explaining pause() functionality), you will want to process the events
 * you accumulated before losing ownership of the partition. Perhaps you also need to close file handles, database
 * connections, and such.
